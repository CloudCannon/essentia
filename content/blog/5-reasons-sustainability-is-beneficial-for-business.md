Reviewing the recently published Fortune 500 ranking of America’s biggest companies, it was impressive to see that almost all of them had corporate social responsibilities, or CSR, listed in their core objectives. Having spent most of my career in corporate America with large corporations, I once cynically viewed social or environmental impact as a check-the-box task for HR manuals, annual reports or website marketing.

Some large companies were forced to embrace sustainability agendas due to pressures from their consumers, media, shareholders and others, and some did so for the benefit of government lobbying or incentives. At one time, many of these enterprises were labeled as brands simply jumping on the bandwagon of sustainability. Some were criticized by challengers and independent competitors for their lack of authenticity or for not having a true mission. And for many of these organizations, sustainability did become something ancillary, not integrated with the core strategy of an organization.

But CSR should now be recognized as a business model in which for-profit companies create social and environmental benefits and impacts while driving their organization’s objectives. This platform has been coined by some as the triple bottom line: people, planet and profit. Other companies refer to this as performance with purpose. And the data does not lie: The World Economic Forum cites that the circular economy alone can translate into $4.5 trillion in economic benefits by 2030.

This translates into a financial strategy opportunity, not simply a financial trade-off. A recent McKinsey report found that reaching net zero by 2050 would require $9.2 trillion in investments until that time.

Even though the average tenure of CEOs is on the decline, the CSO (Chief Sustainability Officer role, not to be confused with Chief Sales Officer) has grown by over 300%.

Traditionally, enterprises that were cause/mission-based had been labeled “green, granola, crunchy tree-huggers” with a stereotype of focusing on lounging versus grinding. This, again, is a misconception. In the digital age, consumers have more information than ever about companies and their products or services: where they are made, with what materials, which workers they hire, and what their plans are. Consumers, investors and governmental agencies do care what the companies do and do not do, and cancel culture applies to them as well.

Sustainability is constantly and heavily promoted by the largest product and service companies in the world, such as GE, Apple, Amazon, Tesla and Whole Foods. There are also many independent companies attacking key initiatives such as reduction of carbon emissions (Entergy), elimination of plastic waste (FloWater) and elevated use of alternative powers (8minute), as a few examples.

Let’s take a look at five reasons sustainability is good for business.

## 1. Attracting And Retaining Employees

These past two and a half years of the Covid-19 era have been marked with what has been called the “Great Resignation,” a time marked by historical numbers of employees choosing to leave their employer for a variety of reasons, including companies not having a CSR agenda. In fact, about a quarter of both Gen-Z and millennial employees have asserted that a company having a sustainability agenda has influenced them to stay. It is a sense of pride to be part of these organizations. Time, cost savings and resource deployment of various departments are also very significant in not requiring companies to endure the recruiting, rehiring and retraining of new talent.

## 2. Value Creation, Cost Reductions And Innovation

Successful companies look at sustainability from a point of considering how they can leverage it to have better returns on capital both operationally and commercially. When companies apply the right methodologies against their sustainability goals, they find ways to use their resources more efficiently, discover costs and supply chain savings, are often able to reduce packaging or service costs and, in many cases, find innovative opportunities to increase profits on their sustainable products.

## 3. Brand Reputation And Consumer Demand

These types of initiatives can have a positive impact on the expansion of the consumer base, a brand’s reputation in the marketplace and customer loyalty. Products and services offered as “sustainable,” alongside very clear and precise marketing, have proven to increase sales and reach and capture a growing audience that cares for their health and the environment. Such marketing also positions the company for positive publicity and potential partnerships with other sustainably focused brands.

## 4. New Opportunities And Emerging Markets

Entering new markets is a two-pronged approach, first in providing products and secondly by providing services at a lower margin in markets that provide share or entering markets that have not been touched but show demand. Having a sustainable product or service in one market can also help lead to a referral to another market prime for expansion. All of this equates to new sales for the organization.

## 5. Competitive Advantage

When conducting a traditional SWOT analysis, a company’s view toward sustainability should be classified as a strength and ideally a differentiator among its competitors. In some instances, when consumers are evaluating their options, it may, in fact, prove the deciding factor for the final choice they make. Some companies leverage this as “first to market” not in terms of their product or service but the way they have positioned themselves in the marketplace.

Bringing Benefits To The Planet As Well As The Bottom Line

Sustainability as a fundamental and critical business practice is here to stay, and the best companies are embracing it as leverage for new growth, revenue and the potential to positively impact society. Just as in the old adage of “adapt or die,” the paradigm continues to shift, and the value of adaptation is real. The companies that do not engage will suffer and have profitability loss, whereas the ones that do will greatly benefit both their companies and our environment.
